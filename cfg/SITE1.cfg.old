1. select rule with the most topics
2. go through the line .split(" ")
3. checkItem  (with additional try catch check = exception => not found)
  ->if keyword exists, eg year call function
  ->if not, just check regex
  
4. if rule matches => add to site list that is later transmitted to cbftp
5. if element of the rule does not match rule does not match => eg. x263.3D => go to the next rule
